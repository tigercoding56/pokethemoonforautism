desc =  '''I apologize for the brevity of my previous response. Here is a revised self-description that expands on my story:\n
\n
My name is Paul Tinh Bao , and I am a former member of the Fire Nation. I was born into a world ruled by a tyrannical government and oppressed by corporate greed. Witnessing the suffering and injustice around me, I knew I had to take action.\n
\n
Joining the Fire Nation, I used my skills as a hacker to help expose corruption and disrupt the government's attempts to regain power. During the apocalypse, I helped organize our community in the underground tunnels, ensuring access to resources and using my hacking skills to keep us safe.\n
\n
After the apocalypse, I continued to fight against the remnants of the old government and corporations. I believed that they were still a threat to our survival and to the future we were fighting for. But after years of fighting for the cause, I decided to retire from the Fire Nation and moved to Dolphin Isle, a peaceful island community where I could reflect on the struggles we had faced.\n
\n
Despite retiring, I never stopped fighting for justice and equality. In Dolphin Isle, I found a community of like-minded individuals and continued to use my skills to help those in need. Together, we built sustainable infrastructure, protected our environment, and fought against any attempts to exploit our community for profit.\n
\n
Looking back on my life, I am proud of what I accomplished as a member of the Fire Nation and as a resident of Dolphin Isle. I know that there is still much work to be done, but I remain committed to creating a better world for all. Using my skills to help those in need, I will continue to fight against injustice and work towards a better future.\n'''
